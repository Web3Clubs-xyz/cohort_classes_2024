## Description
This repo tracks recorded classes for the different cohorts running in Web3Clubs over 2024.

Math cohort (Math4Web3) is a study into Foundational Mathematics for Programmable Cryptography. Implementations are in Rust.
Key areas: Introduction to Mathematical Foundations, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Modular Arithmetic, Complexity Theory, Information Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Advanced Number Theory, Algorithmic Number Theory, Cryptographic Protocols(eg ZKPs, MPC, FHEâ€¦), Applied Cryptography Mathematics

Rust cohort covers general introduction into Rust language. Learners then specialize for specific Rust domains.
